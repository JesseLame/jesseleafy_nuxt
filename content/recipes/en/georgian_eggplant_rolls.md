  A beloved classic from Georgian cuisine, Badrijani Nigvzit features thin slices of fried eggplant rolled around a creamy, spiced walnut-garlic filling. It’s savory, rich, and brightened by a hint of vinegar and fresh herbs. Perfect as a starter or part of a mezze spread.

  These rolls are as beautiful as they are flavorful. The walnut paste is blended with garlic, coriander, cumin, fenugreek, and a touch of chili for warmth. Each bite delivers a perfect balance of creamy, spicy, and tangy.
