ingredients:
  cake:
    - 200 g unsalted butter
    - 200 g caster sugar
    - 8 g vanilla sugar
    - 4 medium eggs
    - 200 g self-rising flour
    - pinch of salt
  chocolate_ganache:
    - 150 g dark chocolate
    - 100 ml heavy cream
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 175°C. Grease and flour a baking pan.
  - In a bowl, beat together the butter, caster sugar, and vanilla sugar until light and creamy.
  - Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition until smooth.
  - Gradually add the self-rising flour and a pinch of salt. Mix until the batter is smooth.
  - Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 60 minutes.
  - Test the cake with a wooden skewer — if it comes out clean, the cake is done.
  - Allow the cake to cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cake cools, prepare the ganache.  
  - Break the chocolate into pieces and place in a bowl.  
  - Heat the cream in a saucepan until just below boiling, then pour it over the chocolate.  
  - Stir until melted and smooth. Let it cool until it reaches a yoghurt-like consistency.
  - Pour the ganache over the cooled cake, letting it drip naturally along the sides.
