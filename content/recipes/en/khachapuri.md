description: A cheesy, warm Georgian bread filled with melty suluguni and Imeretian cheeses.

  Khachapuri is a beloved Georgian comfort food — a soft bread filled with a mixture of cheeses and topped with a runny egg. This version uses mozzarella and feta as substitutions if the traditional cheeses aren't available. It’s perfect for brunch or cozy evenings.

  The dough is simple and yeast-risen, forming a crust that crisps beautifully in the oven. The magic lies in the cheesy center — melty, tangy, and savory — with a bright egg yolk stirred in just before serving.

  Serve hot, straight from the oven. Tear off the crusts and dip into the molten cheese core!

ingredients:
  dough:
    - 175 g all-purpose flour
    - 115 ml warm milk
    - 1 tsp dry yeast
    - 0.5 tsp sugar
    - 4 tsp sunflower oil
  filling:
    - 185 g suluguni (or mozzarella)
    - 185 g Imeretian cheese (or feta)
    - 1 egg

  - In a bowl, mix the warm milk with yeast, sugar, and 2 teaspoons of sunflower oil.
  - Add the flour and mix until combined. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of sunflower oil.
  - Knead gently (do not over-knead) until the dough is smooth. Let it rest in a warm place for 60 minutes, or until doubled in size.
  - Preheat oven to 220–230°C.
  - On a floured surface, roll the dough into a round shape like a pizza base.
  - Combine the cheeses and place them as a ball in the center of the dough.
  - Fold the edges over the cheese and seal them, forming a closed bread.
  - Bake for 10–15 minutes, until golden brown.
  - Serve hot and enjoy!
