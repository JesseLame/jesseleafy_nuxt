ingredients:
  roasted_pumpkin:
    - 450 g pumpkin, cubed
    - 1 tsp smoked paprika
    - 1 tsp dried thyme
    - 1 tbsp olive oil
  risotto_base:
    - 1 onion, finely chopped
    - 3 garlic cloves, minced
    - 300 g risotto rice
    - 150 ml white wine
    - ~1.5 L vegetable bouillon
    - 200 g spinach
    - 100 g parmesan cheese, grated
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180 °C.
  - In a bowl, toss the pumpkin cubes with smoked paprika, thyme, and olive oil. Spread them on a baking tray and roast for about 30 minutes, until tender.
  - Purée about ¾ of the roasted pumpkin with a splash of bouillon until smooth. Reserve the rest for garnish.

  - Gradually add the warm bouillon, one ladle at a time, stirring continuously. Wait for each addition to absorb before adding more, for about 20 minutes.
  - When the rice is almost done, stir in the pumpkin purée and add the spinach in batches until wilted.
  - When the rice is creamy and tender, remove from heat and stir in the parmesan. Let it sit a moment to melt.
  - Serve topped with the reserved roasted pumpkin pieces and a sprinkle of extra cheese if desired.
