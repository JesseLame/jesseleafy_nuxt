ingredients:
  - 45 g all-purpose flour
  - 240 ml whole milk
  - 200 g unsalted butter, at room temperature
  - 200 g powdered sugar
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 200 g chocolate (any kind)
instructions:
  - Sift the flour into a small saucepan and add the milk. Whisk until smooth and free of lumps.
  - Place over medium heat and cook while whisking continuously until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. It should be thick enough to hold a skewer upright.
  - Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap (touching the surface), and let it cool to room temperature. If there are lumps, strain the mixture through a sieve.
  - In another bowl, beat the butter and powdered sugar until light and fluffy.
  - Add the vanilla extract and mix until fully incorporated.
  - Meanwhile, melt two-thirds of the chocolate using a bain-marie. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining chocolate until fully melted and the mixture feels cool to the touch.
  - Once both the flour mixture and the chocolate are at room temperature, gradually mix the flour mixture into the whipped butter.
  - Beat for another 5 minutes until light and creamy.
  - Gradually add the melted white chocolate in portions, mixing well between additions.
  - Your buttercream is now ready to use — perfect for decorating cakes and cupcakes.
