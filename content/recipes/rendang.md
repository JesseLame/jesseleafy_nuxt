description: A rich and aromatic Indonesian-inspired rendang featuring mushrooms, plant-based chicken, and a homemade spice paste.

  This vegan rendang is a cozy, flavor-rich twist on an Indonesian classic — hearty, aromatic, and perfect for slow, mindful cooking. As someone who toggles between code and cuisine, I love how this dish blends precision with soul.

  At its core is a bold boemboe: a spice paste of shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, toasted coconut, and warm spices. Mushrooms and plant-based chicken soak up the creamy, spiced coconut sauce, layered with notes of lime leaf and lemongrass.

  Born on a rainy Utrecht evening, this recipe has become a favorite when I’m craving something grounding yet vibrant. Serve it with rice and a crisp salad, and you’ve got a meal that’s deeply comforting — byte by bite.

    - 4–5 cm galangal
    - 2 tsp ground cumin
    - 2 tsp turmeric powder
    - 1 tsp ground coriander seeds
    - 1 tsp palm sugar
    - 4–5 kaffir lime leaves
    - 4–5 candlenuts (kemiri)
    - 4 tbsp grated coconut
  whole_spices:
    - 1 cinnamon stick
    - 1 star anise
  other:
    - 800 g mushrooms (e.g. oyster, chestnut, or shiitake)
    - 1 container plant-based chicken pieces
    - 2 stalks lemongrass, lightly crushed
    - 250 ml coconut milk
instructions:
  - Toast the candlenuts briefly in a dry pan until lightly golden.
  - Toast the grated coconut in a dry pan until golden brown and fragrant.
  - Roughly chop all the boemboe ingredients, then blend them into a paste using a food processor with a little oil, salt, lemon juice, and black pepper.
  - In a heavy-bottomed pan, sauté the spice paste for a few minutes until aromatic.
  - Add the mushrooms and plant-based chicken, and stir-fry briefly to coat with the paste.
  - Add the coconut milk and just enough water to nearly cover the mixture. Add the lemongrass and stir well.
  - Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender.
  - If the mixture becomes too dry, add a splash of water to maintain a saucy consistency.
  - Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
