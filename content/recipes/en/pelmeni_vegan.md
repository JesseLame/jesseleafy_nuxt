ingredients:
  dough:
    - 240 ml water
    - 112 g butter (vegan if needed)
    - 2 g salt (about 0.5 tsp)
    - 1 large egg (or vegan alternative)
    - 720 g all-purpose flour
  filling:
    - 250 g vegan mince
    - 1 onion, finely chopped
    - 4 garlic cloves, minced
    - 10 g butter (about 1.5 tbsp)
    - 7 g salt (about 1.5 tsp)
    - 4 g ground black pepper (about 2 tsp)
    - 7–15 g dry herbs/spices, optional (0.5–1 tbsp)
    - 15 ml water
instructions:
  - In a medium pot, bring the water and butter to a boil.
  - Add the salt and two cups of flour (approx. 240 g) all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon.
  - Remove from heat, cool slightly, and add the egg (or vegan substitute).
  - Add the remaining flour (about 480 g) and mix until combined. Cover and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.
  - For the filling, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook for 5–7 minutes until soft and slightly golden. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Let cool slightly.
  - In a large bowl, combine vegan mince, cooked onions and garlic, salt, pepper, optional herbs/spices, and water. Mix well.
  - Roll out the dough into a thin sheet. Keep unused dough covered to prevent drying.
  - Cut into 7.5 cm (3 inch) circles. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of filling in the center. Fold in half and seal the edges, pressing out any air.
  - Pinch the corners together to form the classic pelmeni shape.
  - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 1 bay leaf and a few peppercorns.
  - Drop in the pelmeni and cook until they float, about 5 minutes. Do not overcook.
  - Serve drained or in broth. Garnish with sour cream (vegan if desired), melted butter, vinegar, fresh herbs, or sautéed onions.
