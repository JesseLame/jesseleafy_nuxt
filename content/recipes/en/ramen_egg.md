title: Ramen Eggs (Ajitsuke Tamago)
description: Flavorful Japanese-style marinated eggs, perfect for ramen or rice bowls.
description_long: |
  These marinated soft-boiled eggs, known as "ajitsuke tamago," are a ramen shop favorite but equally delicious on their own or served over a warm bowl of rice. The eggs are gently boiled to a creamy, jammy-yolk perfection, then soaked overnight in a savory-sweet soy-based marinade.

  With just a handful of pantry staples, this recipe creates deeply flavorful eggs that are simple yet satisfying. Let them sit in the marinade overnight to fully absorb the umami-rich sauce, and enjoy them chilled or at room temperature.

ingredients:
  eggs:
    - 4 large eggs
  marinade:
    - 60 ml soy sauce
    - 60 ml mirin
    - 60 ml sake (or water)
    - 1 tsp sugar
instructions:
  - In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake (or water), and sugar. Bring to a boil while whisking to dissolve the sugar completely. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool completely.
  - Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs by at least 2.5 cm. Bring to a full boil.
  - Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water with a spoon. Start a timer for 7 minutes as you add the first egg.
  - Reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil. Rotate the eggs gently with chopsticks during the first 3 minutes to help center the yolks.
  - After 7 minutes, transfer the eggs to an ice water bath and chill for 15 minutes.
  - Once cooled, gently crack the eggs at the wide end and peel them carefully.
  - Place peeled eggs in a plastic bag with the cooled marinade. Remove excess air and seal the bag just above the eggs to keep them submerged.
  - Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Rotate occasionally for even marination.
