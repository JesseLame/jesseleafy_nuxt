description: A creamy Peruvian-inspired stew made with mushrooms, vegetarian chicken, and a rich nut-based sauce.

  This vegan version of *Aji de Gallina* reimagines a Peruvian classic with oyster mushrooms and vegetarian chicken simmered in a golden, nutty cream sauce. Traditionally made with shredded chicken and aji amarillo, this version keeps the essence of the dish — warmth, richness, and comfort — while being fully plant-based.

  The creamy sauce gets its body from soaked pecans and bread, blended with red peppers, garlic, and turmeric for a silky, flavorful texture. Served with rice and boiled potatoes, it’s a deeply satisfying dish perfect for cozy evenings.
