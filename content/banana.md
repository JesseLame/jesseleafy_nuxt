  This banana bread is warm, comforting, and just the right kind of sweet — like a hug from the oven. Born from overripe bananas and a need for something cozy, it’s now a staple in my Utrecht kitchen. Moist, flavorful, and easy to whip up with pantry basics, it’s a recipe I come back to again and again.

  Add walnuts, swirl in chocolate, or keep it simple — it always delivers. It’s also surprisingly effective as a peace offering, housewarming gift, or, let’s be honest, the perfect buffer before discussing your dating status.

  Whether you’re baking to impress or just want something nostalgic and nourishing, this loaf has you covered — byte by bite.
