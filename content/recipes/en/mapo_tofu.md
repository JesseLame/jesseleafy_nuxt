  This bold, comforting braise brings together silky tofu and Beyond Meat-style mince in a rich Doubanjiang-infused broth. 
  It’s a simple yet satisfying dish that balances heat, umami, and the gentle bite of five-spice with creamy tofu.

  Inspired by Sichuan-style mapo tofu but adapted with a plant-based twist, this dish is perfect over steamed rice, 
  garnished with scallions and a drizzle of chili oil if you like it hot.

ingredients:
  marinating:
    - 113 g beyond meat mince (or similar plant-based mince)
    - 2 tsp Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
    - 1 tsp light soy sauce
    - 0.5 tsp minced ginger
  braising:
    - 1 tsp cornstarch
    - 1 tbsp vegetable oil
    - 3 tbsp Doubanjiang (use 2 tbsp for less salt and spice)
    - 2 green onions, chopped
    - 396 g firm or medium firm tofu, cut into 1.5 cm cubes
    - 240 ml vegetable stock
    - 2 tsp chili oil (optional)
    - 1 tsp five-spice powder
instructions:
  - In a small bowl, combine the mince, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and ginger. Mix well and set aside to marinate.
  - In another small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water. Set aside.
  - Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated mince and Doubanjiang. Cook, breaking the mince apart with a spatula until it's fully cooked and evenly coated.
  - Add the chopped green onions and stir-fry for 1 minute.
  - Spread the tofu cubes evenly over the mince. Add chili oil (if using) and five-spice powder.
  - Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook on medium-low for 8–10 minutes, or until the sauce reduces by half.
  - Taste and adjust seasoning — add salt or a teaspoon of sugar to balance the heat if needed.
  - Stir the cornstarch mixture again and slowly swirl it into the skillet. Gently stir until the sauce thickens.
  - Turn off heat and transfer to a serving bowl. Serve hot with steamed rice.
