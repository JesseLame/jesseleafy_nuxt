description: Steamed bao buns filled with savory mushrooms and a rich, homemade hoisin sauce.
description_long: |
  This dish features fluffy steamed bao buns packed with umami-rich mushrooms glazed in a sweet, tangy, and nutty hoisin sauce. 
  It's a simple but delicious vegan meal that's great for sharing or a casual bite.

  The hoisin sauce is a homemade blend of soy, peanut butter, vinegar, miso, and spices. While traditional hoisin often includes fermented soybeans, those can be tricky to find — miso makes a great substitute.

  Serve warm with pickled vegetables or a crisp salad for a balanced bite.

ingredients:
  hoisin_sauce:
    - 60 ml light soy sauce
    - 2 tbsp natural peanut butter (or fermented soybean paste)
    - 1 tbsp honey or agave syrup
    - 2 tsp rice vinegar
    - 2 tsp sesame oil
    - 1 garlic clove, grated
    - 1/8 tsp black pepper
    - 1 tsp miso paste
    - 1/2 tsp five spice powder
    - 1 tsp Thai chili sauce
  other:
    - 800 g mushrooms (or other veg), sliced
    - 5–6 bao buns, steamed
instructions:
  - In a bowl, mix together all the hoisin sauce ingredients until smooth.
  - In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté the mushrooms until they release moisture and begin to brown.
  - Add the hoisin sauce to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Cook for another 2–3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
  - Steam the bao buns according to package or recipe instructions.
  - Fill each bun with a generous spoonful of the mushroom mixture.
  - Optional: Serve with pickled cucumbers or shredded cabbage for extra crunch.
notes:
  - Traditionally, fermented soybeans are used in hoisin sauce. Since they're hard to find, miso paste is a great alternative.
