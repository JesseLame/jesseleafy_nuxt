  This rich, plant-forward curry is built on layers of flavor starting with a fresh spice paste, roasted eggplant, and mushrooms. Cashews and Greek yogurt add a luxurious creaminess, while whole spices deepen the aroma and flavor.

  Inspired by South Indian flavors, the combination of methi seeds, curry leaves, and whole masala like cardamom and cinnamon gives this dish warmth and depth. Serve it with rice or naan for a nourishing, satisfying meal.

  Ideal for a weekend cook or when you want to impress friends with a homemade curry that’s bold yet balanced.
