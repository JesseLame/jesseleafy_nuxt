  These vegan Khinkali are a twist on the traditional Georgian dumplings, filled with a juicy mix of Beyond Mince, mushrooms, and aromatic spices. Each dumpling is carefully pleated by hand and boiled until tender and bursting with flavor.

  Serve hot with a grind of black pepper and a side of vinegar dip or salad. They're hearty, fun to make, and deeply satisfying.
