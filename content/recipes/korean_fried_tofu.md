  This Korean-style crispy tofu packs a punch with its sweet, spicy, and umami-rich glaze. Gochujang, a fermented red chili paste, is the star of the sauce — balanced by honey, soy, vinegar, and aromatic garlic and ginger. 

  Perfectly crisp tofu cubes are first air-fried or pan-fried, then tossed in the sticky sauce until each bite is coated in flavor. Serve it over steamed rice or noodles, and garnish with sesame seeds and green onions for extra flair.

  Whether cooked in a pan or air fryer, this dish is a fast, satisfying way to bring Korean flavors to your dinner table.

ingredients:
  sauce:
    - 3 tbsp gochujang
    - 2 tbsp ketchup
    - 3 tbsp honey or corn syrup

    - 1 tbsp rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
    - 2 garlic cloves, finely minced
    - 1 tsp grated ginger (optional)

  - In a saucepan, heat sesame oil over medium heat. Sauté garlic and ginger until fragrant.
  - Add gochujang, ketchup, honey, soy sauce, vinegar, and water (if needed). Stir well and simmer for 2–3 minutes until slightly thickened.
