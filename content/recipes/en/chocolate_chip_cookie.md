  These classic chocolate chip cookies are a perfect treat — rich, buttery, and packed with gooey chocolate chips. A short chill in the fridge deepens their flavor and gives you that ideal texture: slightly crisp outside with a soft, chewy middle.

  Whether you're baking for a special occasion or just because, these cookies are a timeless favorite. Serve with a cold glass of milk or a hot cup of coffee for ultimate enjoyment.
