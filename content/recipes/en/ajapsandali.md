  Ajapsandali is a traditional Georgian vegetable stew, beloved for its rich, smoky flavor and vibrant ingredients. Eggplant, bell peppers, and tomatoes are simmered gently with garlic and herbs until meltingly soft and fragrant.

  This dish is perfect as a warm main or a cold mezze-style side. It’s simple, plant-based, and deeply satisfying — a celebration of the late summer harvest.

  Whether served fresh off the stove or chilled the next day, ajapsandali captures the soul of Georgian home cooking with minimal effort and maximum flavor.
