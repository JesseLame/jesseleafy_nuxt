  These vegetarian wontons are a satisfying fusion of texture and flavor — juicy, savory, and delicately seasoned. They make for a perfect appetizer or a comforting bowl when served in broth.

  Replacing traditional pork and shrimp with plant-based mince and shiitake mushrooms makes these wontons suitable for vegetarians while maintaining the umami-packed taste we all love. Serve them steamed, boiled, or fried — with a tangy dipping sauce or in a fragrant soup.
