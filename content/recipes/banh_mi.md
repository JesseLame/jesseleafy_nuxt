  This plant-based bánh mì is a delightful fusion of savory, spicy, and tangy flavors. Marinated king oyster mushrooms provide a meaty bite, complemented by fresh herbs, pickled daikon and carrot, cucumber slices, and a zesty lime mayo. A perfect balance in a crusty baguette — it’s a quick and satisfying meal that bursts with character.

  Inspired by classic Vietnamese street food, this version is a modern, vegetarian twist that doesn’t compromise on depth or crunch. Whether for lunch or a light dinner, it hits all the right notes.
