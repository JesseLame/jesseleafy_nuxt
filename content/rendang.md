  This vegan rendang is a soul-warming, flavor-packed dish that brings the deep, complex essence of Indonesian cuisine right to your kitchen. As someone who splits his time between debugging software and exploring cultures through their food, I find rendang to be a dish that truly embodies patience, balance, and storytelling — not unlike crafting the perfect piece of code.

  The heart of this dish lies in the boemboe — an aromatic spice paste made from shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, toasted coconut, and a medley of warming spices. Slowly sautéed, it forms the foundation of flavor that makes rendang so uniquely rich and comforting. Traditionally a slow-cooked beef stew, this plant-based version uses earthy mushrooms and tender vegan chicken to soak up all those fragrant, caramelized notes.

  I first started making this dish on a gray Utrecht evening, looking for something grounding and vibrant. What emerged was a deeply savory, creamy stew with just the right hit of heat and citrus brightness from kaffir lime and lemongrass. It’s hearty, layered, and somehow nostalgic — even if you didn’t grow up with it.

  Whether you’re a seasoned lover of Indonesian food or discovering rendang for the first time, this recipe is a deeply satisfying culinary project. It rewards a bit of prep with a dish that fills your kitchen with intoxicating aromas and your plate with richness. Pair it with steamed jasmine rice and maybe a fresh cucumber salad, and you’ve got a meal that hits every note — byte by bite.
