title: Thai red curry paste
description: A bold and fragrant chili paste made from a blend of dried chilies, spices, and herbs — the heart of many Southeast Asian dishes.
description_long: |
  This chili spice paste brings together the fiery complexity of dried red chilies with the citrusy freshness of lemongrass and lime leaves. Carefully ground and blended with aromatics like galangal, garlic, and shallots, it forms a powerful base for curries, soups, and stir-fries.

  Combining both mild and hot dried chilies, this paste strikes a balance between heat and depth. Whether you're making rendang, laksa, or a custom curry, this homemade bumbu delivers a flavor profile that dried powders can't match.

  Use immediately or store in the fridge for up to a week — a little goes a long way to elevate your dishes.
