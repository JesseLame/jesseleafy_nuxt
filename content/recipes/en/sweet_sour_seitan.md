  This vibrant dish pairs crispy air-fried mushrooms and meat alternatives with a glossy, sweet-and-sour sauce. Perfect for weeknight dinners, it delivers bold flavor with minimal effort — ideal when you want something fast, satisfying, and just a little indulgent.

  The sauce balances tangy vinegar with savory soy sauce and the subtle warmth of Shaoxing wine, rounded out with brown sugar. Stir-fried garlic, ginger, and vegetables give it crunch and aroma, while the quick-cooked plant-based protein delivers bite.

  Serve it hot with jasmine rice or noodles. A reliable go-to when you want takeout-style flavor at home — with less grease and more control.
