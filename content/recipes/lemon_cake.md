  This flourless lemon clementine cake is deeply fragrant and tender, perfect for citrus lovers. The original recipe calls for clementines, but this version is made entirely with lemons for a tart, zingy twist.

  Made with whole boiled lemons, ground almonds, and no flour, it's naturally gluten-free and incredibly moist. The sharpness of the lemon is balanced by a lemon glaze made with powdered sugar and fresh juice. This cake keeps well and is even better the next day.

ingredients:
  cake:
  - 375 g whole lemons (approx. 3 medium)
  - 6 large eggs
  - 250 g white sugar
  - 250 g ground almonds
  - 1 tsp baking powder (gluten-free if necessary)
  - Butter (for greasing)
  For the glaze:
  - 175 g powdered (icing) sugar
  - 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice
  - 1 tbsp water
servings: 8–10
instructions:
  - Put the whole lemons in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 2 hours, then drain and let cool.
  - Cut each lemon in half, remove any seeds, and blend the lemons (skin, pulp, and all) into a smooth purée.
  - Preheat oven to 190°C (gas mark 5 / 375°F). Grease and line a 21 cm / 8-inch springform tin.
  - In a large bowl or food processor, beat the eggs. Add the sugar, ground almonds, and baking powder. Mix well.
  - Add the lemon purée and mix until fully combined.
  - Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Bake for about 60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. After 40 minutes, cover loosely with foil to prevent over-browning if needed.
  - Let the cake cool completely in the tin on a rack.
  - Once cooled, remove from the tin. For the glaze, mix powdered sugar with lemon juice and water until smooth, then pour over the cake.
