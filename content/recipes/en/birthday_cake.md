ingredients:
  cake:
    - 250 g unsalted butter, at room temperature
    - 250 g fine granulated sugar
    - 5 medium eggs
    - 2 tsp vanilla extract
    - 250 g flour
    - 2 tsp baking powder
    - 1/2 tsp salt
    - 50 g sprinkles of your choice
  other:
    - 1 batch chocolate buttercream (/recipes/chocolate_buttercream.md)
instructions:
  - Prepare the buttercream in advance for easy assembly.
  - In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until creamy.
  - Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract.
  - Add the flour, baking powder, salt and mix on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix.
  - Divide the batter into three greased and parchment-lined cake pans. This ensures even baking and better results than using a single large pan.
  - Bake the layers at 160 °C (top and bottom heat) for 25–30 minutes, until golden and a skewer comes out clean.
  - Let the cakes cool in their pans for a few minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
  - Once cooled, level the tops of the cakes with a serrated knife if necessary.
  - Spread a layer of buttercream on top of the first cake layer, then place the second layer on top. Repeat with the third layer.
  - Use the remaining buttercream to frost the top and sides of the cake.
  - Decorate with additional sprinkles if desired.
