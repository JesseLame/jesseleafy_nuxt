  This savory mushroom pâté is a luxurious spread with French flair, ideal for a rustic appetizer board or an elegant vegan dish. 

  It begins with duxelles—mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme cooked down to a concentrated, caramelized base. A splash of sherry deepens the umami, while optional ingredients like miso, soy sauce, and lemon juice let you tune brightness and body.

  A simple porcini roux ensures sliceability once chilled. Great on crackers or as a rich sandwich layer—especially in a vegan bánh mì. Keep a log in the fridge for an impromptu indulgence.

ingredients:
  mushrooms:
    - 600 g mixed mushrooms (e.g., cremini, shiitake, porcini)
    - 30 g unsalted butter or olive oil
    - 1 small shallot or onion (60 g), minced
    - 2 garlic cloves, minced
    - 1 tsp fresh thyme
    - 60 ml dry sherry or white wine
    - 30 g cashews or walnuts, toasted
    - salt, black pepper, pinch of nutmeg to taste
    - 1 tbsp soy sauce (optional)
    - 1 tbsp lemon juice (optional)
    - 1 tbsp miso paste (optional)
  roux:
    - 30 g butter or olive oil
    - 20 g flour
    - 10 g dried porcini mushrooms, ground
    - 100 ml vegetable stock or plant milk
instructions:
  - In a skillet, heat 30 g butter or oil. Sauté shallot and garlic for 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 12–15 minutes, stirring often, until the moisture evaporates and mushrooms start to brown.
  -  Add the sherry or white wine. Simmer until the liquid is nearly gone, concentrating flavor and cooking off alcohol.
  -  In a separate pan, melt 30 g butter. Stir in flour and ground porcini. Cook for 2–3 minutes until pale golden. Off heat, whisk in stock gradually until a smooth, thick paste forms.
  -  Combine the hot mushroom mixture with roux paste, walnuts, and nutmeg in a food processor. Add miso, soy sauce, or lemon juice if using. Blitz to desired texture.
  - Line a small loaf tin or container with plastic wrap. Spoon in the mixture, press firmly to eliminate air pockets, and cover. Chill for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight) until firm.
