  These vegan gyoza are a delicious take on the classic Japanese dumplings, filled with a savory mix of cabbage, mushrooms, green onions, and vegetarian mince. The filling is seasoned with toasted sesame oil and soy sauce, then wrapped in delicate gyoza skins.

  Perfect as a snack, appetizer, or main dish, these gyoza are crispy on the bottom, tender on top, and bursting with umami flavor. Enjoy them with a dipping sauce of your choice or a splash of rice vinegar.

  Great for freezing too—make a big batch and enjoy homemade gyoza anytime.
